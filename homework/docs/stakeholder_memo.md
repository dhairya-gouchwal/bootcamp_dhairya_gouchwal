#Marked down Stakeholder Memo:

**To:** Investment Management Team  
**From:** Dhairya Gouchwal  
**Subject:** Portfolio Comparison & Credit Risk Optimization Model  

## Overview
This project will deliver a portfolio analysis and optimization tool that compares a given portfolio's market and credit risk performance against 
benchmark funds. Using both historical market data and asset-level credit risk parameters (PD, LGD, EAD), the tool will assess risk-adjusted returns and
highlight vulnerabilities to borrower defaults.

## Value to Stakeholders
In addition to analysis, the tool will apply optimization techniques to propose improved allocations, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio, minimize 
expected credit loss, or balance both objectives. This will allow stakeholders to make informed reallocation decisions, enhancing returns while reducing 
credit exposure.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with portfolio analysis and optimization workflows  
- Comparison visualizations (risk-return plots, credit loss charts)  
- Summary report of findings and recommendations
