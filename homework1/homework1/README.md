# Project Title - Portfolio Comparison and Optimization
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)
## Problem Statement
< Portfolio Comparison and optimatization: The aim of the project is to see how a portfolio performs compared to similar funds, considering both 
market and credit risk. It will measure common performance stats like annualized return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio along with credit risk measures like
expected loss and risk adjusted return. The idea is to see where the portfolio is doing well, where it could be better, and then run optimization to 
suggest changes that could improve returns while keeping risk under control.>
## Stakeholder & User
< The main stakeholder is an investment manager or financial analyst, but the end users could also be institutional investors, portfolio managers, or 
risk team. Any instituion can use it - Banks, hedge funds, mutual funds etc.>
## Useful Answer & Decision
<The The project will give a clear breakdown of both market and credit risk measures for the portfolio and the benchmark funds, using charts and summary 
tables. It will also include some predictive parts, like running scenarios to see how credit losses might change under different conditions. The final 
answer will be an improved version of the portfolio that aims to keep or boost returns while reducing credit risk. >
## Assumptions & Constraints
<Bullets: Assumptions
Data: Historical prices will be used 
Credit: PD, LGD, EAD are provided or estimated.
Timeframe: Same period for all assets.
Market: Past trends indicate near-future behavior.
Risk-free: Constant rate for Sharpe calculation

Bullets: Constraint
Source: Only public data used.
Assets: Optimization limited to current portfolio.
Weights: Non-negative, sum to 100%.
Granularity: Credit data may be aggregated
>
## Known Unknowns / Risks
<Bullets: Market risk - tests include Volitility measuremnent, VaR, Sharpe Ratio, Scenario Analysis. Credit Risk - tests include Stress testing, Credit 
VaR, Expected loss, and exposure analysis>
## Lifecycle Mapping
Goals for Stage Deliverable
- <Goal 1: Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage#1) - Project Scope Paragraph & Stakeholder Memo
Goal 2: Data Collection & Preparation (Stage #2)- Historical prices, benchmark data, and credit risk inputs in /data/
Goal 3:Portfolio Analysis (Stage #3)- Descriptive tables & visualizations of market and credit risk metrics
Goal 4: Comparison with Benchmarks (Stage #4) - Comparative charts and summary tables showing portfolio vs peer funds
Goal 5: Optimization (Stage  #5)- Optimized portfolio allocation balancing return and credit risk
Goal 6: Reporting & Documentation (Stage #6) - README.md, Jupyter Notebook with analysis, and visual outputs>
